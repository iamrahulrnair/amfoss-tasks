## Bandit

This was a cool task, i've got to work with new command like base64, strings, grep which i've rarely used in shell, I had some starting trouble like i couldn't connect to the ssh client from bandit shell later i figured it out why, then past that other tasks were able to complete quickly ðŸ˜„.
