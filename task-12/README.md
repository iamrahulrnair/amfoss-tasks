## Blockchain Transaction <img width="40px" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2152/2152488.png">

**Blockchain** is super smart. Built a peer to peer transaction model with JavaScript backed by typescript. This model uses **sha1** hashing which will be 20 bytes long and proof of work set to minimum so that you can validate the blocks with ease.

Run the entire model in just a single command - `npm run buildblocks`
