I have been using **ubuntu** for past couple of months now, my experience with **ubuntu** installation  was kind of easy ,I have gone for the basic installation manager since i am new to ubuntu , but post installation was little bit tedious. Some bug along the installation damaged my network card and had to spent some time troubleshooting and updating  bios to make it right. Now the os is working smooth and fine. 

**Things needed**
 - [ ] ubuntu ISO file
 - [ ] any bootable device to mount the ISO file, (i used rufus to create my usb as bootable drive)
 - [ ]  patience ðŸ¥²

**Steps**
 - [ ] burn the iso to the device (make sure to format it)
 - [ ] restart and open the boot-menu (pressing f8 on boot in my case)
 - [ ] select the ubuntu bootloader
 - [ ] rest will be obvious
 - [ ] go for easy installation if you are a beginner ,ubuntu will take care everything for you ðŸ˜‡
