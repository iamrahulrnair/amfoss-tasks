## Webscarping with go <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/golang.png"/>

This task was super fun, i got to learn about a new compiled language, checked out bunch of scraping frameworks. I used **colly** initially and had issues regarding **CSR** sites, then eventually to chromedp which is powerful enough to scrape dynamic sites, and thanks to the people **@Amfoss** for assisting me in the process ðŸ˜‡.
