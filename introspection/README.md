### 1. Why must we choose you?

I am a constant knowledge seeker and i would very much love to learn new things and explore new stuffs. I am 100% sure that my exploration will surely catalyses the growth of club by imparting my knowledge to my fellow juniors as well as sharing what i know to my friends/colleagues. I have been curious about open source and was thinking about working on a larger code base and get my hand dirty which i haven't done in my life. I am sure that, all that matters for **Amfoss** is this curiousness.

### 2. What is your plan for the next 6 months?

- [ ] I have done some courses on **Microservices**, i'd love to explore that.
- [ ] I have been thinking about learning and going in depth with a compiled language probably i'll go with **Golang**. i liked doing tasks in that.
- [ ] Need to strengthen my portfolio so need to work on some large projects with an actual goal/ purpose.

### 3. 1. How would you contribute back to the club?

I have written **many** lines of code in the span of just a few months with absolute self learning and clustering resources from many points and used to spend almost 8 to 10 hrs a day after i resigned, coding, learning, building things with what i have learned. The projects that i have created are basically a clone or something basic, or something which are previously built with a stable code base than mine. I want to level up, i want work on actual projects. This needs can only be satisfied by **Opensource** and i could not find any match other than **Amfoss**.

### 4. 1. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

The process was cool, but i found the discord channel little silent throughout days comparing with other clubs channel. Other thing is , It will be good that the selection process for **MCA** and **btech/bca** done separately because the time gap is kinda huge for task submission and PG students dont have Time ( 2Years < 4yrs ) like UG students and are likely more experienced ðŸ˜Š
